# Developing-Data-Products-Shiny-App
This is the final project for Developing Data Products.

This Shiny App simply takes the user input, in the form of a slider, and multiplies it by 5.

This repository contains both the server.R and ui.R files that make up the code for the shiny app as well as the code for the presentation that is published on RPubs.
